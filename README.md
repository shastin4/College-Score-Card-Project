For this project, I analyzed the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard dataset.

My task is to come up with an interesting question to ask about the dataset which can then be answered using:

visualizations
summary statistics
either inference or modeling

I'll be working with the College Scorecard dataset started by The Obama Administration in September 2015. Each row in this dataset contains information about a college in the USA.
The college dataset includes data on a huge range of issues, including:

location
demographics
admission standards
tuition rates
graduation rates
student loans
outcomes after graduation
... and many more (almost 2000 different variables!)
This is a large dataset that contains millions of individual cells. 

My project report contains the following sections:

Introduction
Preprocessing
Visualization
Summary Statistics
